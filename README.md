Started a new hobby for myself. something I can enjoy beside playing games.

Day 1 of learning
Took me about 1 hour and 20 minutes, maybe?, to make, to learn, and run the program correctly.

Had some snag in the learning process where I put in different names from my object to my code, thus crashing the game.

But overall, it was a satisfying process to go through.

LESSON LEARNED: Be more thorough when creating the code!
